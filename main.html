		<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
		<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in 
			computer science that measures how the runtime
			of an algorithm grows as the input size
			increases. Understanding time complexity helps
			developers write efficient code by analyzing 
			and comparing different algorithmic approaches. An algorithm with better time complexity will scale more effectively as data grows, making it crucial for optimizing performance in real-world applications. Common complexities include O(1) for constant time operations, O(n) for linear operations, O(nÂ²) for nested loops, and O(log n) for divide-and-conquer algorithms 
			like binary search.</p>
		<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory 
			an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
			An algorithm with O(n) space complexity requires
			memory proportional to the input size, such as 
			creating a new array to store results. Minimizing
			space complexity is important for memory-constrained
			environments and overall application performance.</p>
